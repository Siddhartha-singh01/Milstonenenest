# Dashboard Stats - Now Dynamic! 🎉

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The dashboard stats cards now **automatically update** based on your actual tasks instead of showing hardcoded numbers.

## 📊 Dynamic Stats

### Before (Hardcoded):
- Active Tasks: Always showed "24"
- Completed: Always showed "156"

### After (Dynamic):
- **Active Tasks**: Shows actual count of tasks in "To Do" + "In Progress"
  - Change indicator: Shows how many are "to do"
- **Completed**: Shows actual count of tasks in "Done"
  - Change indicator: Shows how many are "in progress"

## 🔄 Real-time Updates

The stats now update automatically when you:
- ✅ Create a new task
- ✅ Move a task between columns (To Do → In Progress → Done)
- ✅ Delete a task
- ✅ Edit a task's status

## 📈 Stats Breakdown

1. **Active Tasks**
   - Counts: To Do + In Progress tasks
   - Shows: Total number of tasks you're working on
   - Change: Displays how many are in "To Do"

2. **Completed**
   - Counts: Done tasks
   - Shows: Total number of finished tasks
   - Change: Displays how many are "In Progress"

3. **Team Members** (Still static)
   - Shows: 8 members
   - Note: This will be dynamic when team features are added

4. **Milestones** (Still static)
   - Shows: 5 milestones
   - Note: This will be dynamic when milestone features are added

## 🎯 Example

If you have:
- 2 tasks in "To Do"
- 1 task in "In Progress"  
- 0 tasks in "Done"

The dashboard will show:
- **Active Tasks**: 3 (with "2 to do")
- **Completed**: 0 (with "1 in progress")

## 💡 Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
- Percentage change from previous week/month
- Trend indicators (↑ ↓)
- Task completion rate
- Average time to complete
- Team member activity tracking
