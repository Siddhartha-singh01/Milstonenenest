Milestonenest Implementation Plan
Goal Description
Build a comprehensive project tracking system named "Milestonenest". The application will feature task management, milestone tracking, progress visualization (Gantt/Kanban), dependency management, and collaboration tools.

User Review Required
IMPORTANT

I will be using Vite + React for this application as it requires complex state management and interactivity (Gantt charts, Drag-and-drop). I will use Vanilla CSS for styling to maintain full control and flexibility, as per the guidelines.
